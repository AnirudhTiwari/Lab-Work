abstract="The location of structural domains in proteins is predicted from the amino acid sequence, based on the analysis of a computed contact map for the protein, the average distance map (ADM). Interactions between residues i and j in a protein are subdivided into several ranges, according to the separation |i-j| in the amino acid sequence. Within each range, average spatial distances between every pair of amino acid residues are computed from a data base of known protein structures. Infrequently occurring pairs are omitted as being statistically insignificant. The average distances are used to construct a predicted ADM. The ADM is analyzed for the occurrence of regions with high densities of contacts (compact regions). Locations of rapid changes of density between various parts of the map are determined by the use of scanning plots of contact densities. These locations serve to pinpoint the distribution of compact regions. This distribution, in turn, is used to predict boundaries of domains in the protein. The technique provides an objective method for the location of domains both on a contact map derived from a known three-dimensional protein structure, the real distance map (RDM), and on an ADM. While most other published methods for the identification of domains locate them in the known three-dimensional structure of a protein, the technique presented here also permits the prediction of domains in proteins of unknown spatial structure, as the construction of the ADM for a given protein requires knowledge of only its amino acid sequence.",
